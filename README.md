# Welcome to Papaya’s Pairing Exercise!

This is a standard [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate.

> **Note**

This pairing exercise is designed to mimic a normal day’s work. We’ll outline a task and the goal will be to
work towards it. You can look up and refer to any docs you like as you would during a normal day’s work.
So please feel free to modify any of the existing code and install any npm packages you would like to mimic the
normal development setup and set of packages you are most comfortable with.

## During the interview

We’ll set out a task and ask that you complete it while explaining your though process. During a normal pairing session
all parties chip to help out and chip in with their own ideas. We aim to have a discussion as much as we aim to see
working code.

We look forward to meeting you!
