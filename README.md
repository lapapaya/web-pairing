# Welcome to Papaya's Pairing Exercise!

This is a standard [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate.

> **Note**
> If you prefer TypeScript you can switch to the `typescript` branch of this repository

This pairing exercise is designed to mimic a normal day's work. We'll outline a task and the goal will be to
work towards it. You can look up and refer to any docs you like as you would during a normal day's work.

So please feel free to modify any of the existing code and install any npm packages you would like to mimic the
normal development setup and set of packages you are most comfortable with.

## During the interview

We'll set out a task and ask that you complete it while explaining your though process. During a normal pairing session
all parties chip to help out and chip in with their own ideas. We aim to have a discussion as much as we aim to see
working code.

We look forward to meeting you!

## I'm not that comfortable with react

That's totally fine! We know there is more to an engineer than the the stack or technology they know. If you're more comfortable
with a different frontend toolchain feel free to come to the pairing exercise with a "create-react-app" like setup.

```
$ ng new angular-app
$ vue create hello-world
$ npx create-next-app@latest
$ npm create svelte@latest myapp
...
or equivalent
```
